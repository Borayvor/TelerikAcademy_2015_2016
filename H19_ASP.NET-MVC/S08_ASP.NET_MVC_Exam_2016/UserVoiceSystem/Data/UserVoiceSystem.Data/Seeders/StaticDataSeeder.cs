For all intents and purposes Microsoft now views Silverlight as “Done”. While it is no longer in active development it is still being “supported” through to 2021 (source).

However there is still a section of the .Net community that would like to see further development done on the Silverlight framework. A quick look at some common request lists brings up the following stats:

* 5,720+ votes to release Silverlight 6 https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/3556619-silverlight-6 
* Feature requests for Silverlight http://dotnet.uservoice.com/forums/4325-silverlight-feature-suggestions

Rather than letting Silverlight decay in a locked up source control in the Microsoft vaults, I call on them to instead release it into the hands of the community to see what they can build with it. Microsoft may no longer have a long term vision for it, but the community itself may find ways to extend it in ways Microsoft didn’t envision. 
Earlier this year Microsoft open sourced RIA Services on Outer Curve http://www.outercurve.org/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery/OpenRIAServices, it would be great to see this extended to the entire Silverlight framework.",

                Description = @"I'm writing this on behalf of the thousands of other Visual Studio users out there who have had nightmares trying to uninstall previous versions of VS. Thus cumulatively losing hundreds of thousands of productive work hours.

During this year, I had installed the following programs/components on my system: 
* Visual Studio 2012 Express for Desktop 
* Visual Studio 2012 Express for Web 
* Team Foundation Server Express 
* SQL Server Express 
* SQL Server Data Tools 
* LightSwitch 2011 trial (which created a VS 2010 installation) 
* Visual Studio 2010 Tools for SQL Server Compact 3.5 SP2 
* Entity Framework Designer for Visual Studio 2012 
* Visual Studio Tools for Applications 
* Visual Studio Tools for Office 
* F# Tools for Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web

Two weeks ago I discovered that third-party controls can't be added to the Express versions of VS. I'm disabled and live on a fixed income, so spending $500 for the Professional version, in order to continue my hobby programming with a third-party control, was a tough decision. But I bought it.

When it arrived, I figured it would take an hour or two to remove the above programs and then I could install the Pro version. I wanted to have a clean file system and Registry for the new install of VS Pro.

It's now SIX DAYS later, and my spending 12-14 hours a day working on this alone. Removing these programs was the biggest nightmare I have ever faced with Microsoft products in my 30 years of being a Microsoft customer. Each one of these products automatically installed 5, 10 or more additional components, along with many thousands of files and individual Registry entries.

It took me four days alone, just to successfully remove the LightSwitch 2011 trial, and the entire VS 2010 product it installed. Restoring a 600 GB disk drive (5 hours) from backup after every removal attempt failed miserably. I finally gave up, spent 6 hours downloading the entire VS 2010 ISO and installed it. Only then, was I able to successfully uninstall LightSwitch 2011 and VS 2010.

As for the remaining products listed above, the uninstall programs do NOT UNinstall everything that they automatically INstall. Every single, automatically INstalled component, had to be removed manually, one at a time. Along with manually creating a System Restore point before each removal attempt, in case it failed. In total, I spent 12 hours uninstalling the remaining products.

I have a Registry search program where I can enter a search string and it will list ALL occurrences it finds in the Registry. I checked ""visual studio"", ""visualstudio"", ""vbexpress"", ""vcexpress"", ""SQL Server"", etc. I never finished searching for all the possible Visual Studio and SQL Server strings because the results being returned were eye-popping. Each search was returning 1,000, 3,000, even 7,000 individual Registry entries that had NOT been removed by the individual uninstall processes. This is TENS of THOUSANDS of never to be used again Registry entries that these programs simply left behind. The size of my Registry file is now a stunning 691 MB!

All of this frustration and wasted time is completely avoidable!And my case is not ""isolated"".There are hundreds of thousands of hits on Google regarding this problem,
                that point to Microsoft forums,
                MS Blog sites,
                and many independent Windows developer support forums on the web.

Microsoft really should provide an uninstall program that actually works,
                by UNinstalling everything it INstalls-- for each product it sells-- including Visual Studio.The downloadable(from Microsoft) uninstall program for VS 2010 does not work correctly and does not remove everything that VS 2010 installs.

When a program installs multiple individual components, tens of thousands of files and Registry entries, it SHOULD have an uninstaller that removes ALL of this, automatically, just like the install program.The OS and Registry keep track of dependencies and you folks know what the removal order should be for all of these products.So the team that creates the INstall program for each product, should also create the UNinstall program.And, the product should NOT ship until this program works correctly and fully.

You have ONE install program for each version of Visual Studio, that asks the user what they want to install and then does it ALL automatically.You should also have ONE uninstall program that does the same thing in reverse...
* Collect info on all the VS - related products and components currently installed
* Ask the user what they want to remove
* Determine if their selections make sense
* Check for dependencies by using your knowledge and experience, along with the computer's stored information, and warn the user as needed 
* Decide on the removal order
*Then do it ALL automatically-- removing ALL files and ALL Registry entries

When you release a new product version, ADD the new version and additional decision logic to this existing program, do NOT create a new uninstall program.This way, the user can also remove previous version products, components, etc.ONE uninstall program* should be* able to uninstall every version of Visual Studio released in the past 10 years, along with every single component that was available with it, AND all of the associated files and Registry entries.

Please don't tell us why it CAN'T be done.Rather, figure out a way to do it, and then make it happen, just like every other software company out there has already done for their products. Even FREEware providers have better uninstall processes than Microsoft.This is a sad state for Microsoft and it should be rectified SOON.

Thank you.",

                Description = @"This vote is for developers who wish to see the idea of a ubiquitous .NET client application development model created by Microsoft and the Visual Studio team.

A ubiquitous .NET client application development model is a model that is defined in .NET-based technologies and is able to run in a multitude of runtime environments -- both native-compiled (store-hosted) and web-hosted.

A *very* rough image of the vision can be found here: 
http://i0.wp.com/blog.developers.win/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Vision.png

The goal is to enable *one* .NET Client Application Project to build deliverables for the following platforms: 
1) Windows 10 
2) Legacy Windows 
3) *nix (Unix/Linux) 
4) Droid 
5) iOS 
6) Macintosh 
7) HTML5 
8) ??? (Extendible to different, future platforms)

In order to achieve the above, a ubiquitous .NET client application development model should strive to possess the following qualities: 
1) Native Cross-Platform Capable - For native-compiled/store-hosted scenarios (iOS/Droid/Windows Store) 
2) HTML5-Compliant - For web-hosted scenarios, via .NET-to-JavaScript transpilation 
3) Consistent User Experience - For brand recognition, reinforcement, and optimal usability across all known scenarios 
4) Cross-Boundary Accessibility - For shared code/assemblies between server and client boundaries 
5) Xaml-Powered - Harnessing one of the greatest inventions in Microsoft's great history 
6) Object Serialization Congruence - Markup used to describe serialized objects is what is created in memory 
7) Holistic Development Consistency - The same guidelines and conventions are used in both client and server scenarios

For more information around this idea and the qualities above, a series of articles has been created to discuss the notion of a ubiquitous .NET client application development model at length. You can view that series here: 
http://blog.developers.win/series/bridge-to-dotnet-ubiquity/
